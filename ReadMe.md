# About

This code provided as is no warranties. I do not own Dragonlock, I am not distributing Dragonlock. This is just a set of scripts that will take a purchased dragonlock stl and transform it into a different form.

# TODO:

- break into utility functions
- complete whole starter set
- complete some expansion sets
- convert to openlock
- add ui
- make console-runnable, create build script
